## More About Me<br>

Hi there!  I'm Sarah. I've been told on more than one occasion that I am an analytical person.  I guess that explains my curious nature, my love of problem-solving, and my need to ask questions to weigh all my options before making a decision.  While you can count on me as a member of Team Analytical, I am also a creative soul.  I like building and creating things too.  You might catch me working on a home DIY project, conjuring up a crafty gift for a friend, or better yet, creating something fun and educational to help myself and others learn more about the world of data as I navigate the ins and outs of networking on LinkedIn.<br><br>

As a Mammographer with a specialty in Quality Assurance, I know the importance of using data to extract insights that help make informed decisions. As I work towards transitioning to a more technical role as a Data Analyst, I have gained valuable experience through **projects**.  My Data Science Certification and other courses, as well as, my personal projects have given me a solid foundation in **Excel, SQL, and Tableau**.  I even have knowledge of **Python and R**.  One of the things about the field of Data Science and Analytics that immediately drew me in has been the breadth of subjects that compile it all.  I love learning and teaching myself new things and with data, I will never run out of subject matter or challenges to dive into.<br><br>  

I've worked in clinical healthcare for over 15 years now and my experiences with patients and coworkers have helped me develop strong problem-solving, leadership, and communication skills. I know how to communicate complex ideas effectively so that they are understood by multiple audiences.  I have served as a Multi-Modality Technologist, Team Lead, and I have trained and mentored many fellow technologists.  My various roles in healthcare help demonstrate that I also possess the soft skills necessary of a data analyst.   Working in healthcare requires you to be flexible, adabtable, a team-player, and excellent at prioritization.  

My goal is to take my new technical skills in data and my transferable skills from healthcare and apply them to a data analyst role within a healthcare company.  <br><br>

When I am not working on data projects, I love hanging out with my family, cuddling my animals, binging a new TV series or watching movies, plant-based cooking, and discovering new books and music.<br>
