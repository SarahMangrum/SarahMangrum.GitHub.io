---

- ðŸ“Š The are over **1.24 Million** transactions with the IDA and the **total amount owed** is **over $19 Trillion US Dollars**

- ðŸ“Š The **average service rate charge** for an IDA loan was **0.77%**.  Rates were as high as **4.95%** and as low as **0%**.


## THE DATA
---

Using **SQL**, I conducted a comprehensive financial analysis of credits and grants issued by the **International Development Association (IDA)**, 1 of the 5 institutions of **The World Bank**.  The **IDA** provides concessional financing to some of the world's poorest countries to help lift themselves out of poverty. This financing lets countries work toward economic efficiency providing access to health, nutrition, social services, and a better quality of life. 

~worldbank.org

The data consists of over **1.24M rows** and **30 columns** provided from **November 2022**. It is also updated monthly by the 10th business day at [**TheWorldBank.org**](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IDA-Statement-Of-Credits-and-Grants-Historical-Dat/tdwh-3krx). As noted on the site, the **IDA** credits are public and publicly guaranteed debt extended by the World Bank Group. The **IDA** provides development credits, grants, and guarantees to its recipient member countries to help meet their development needs.  Credits from the **IDA** are at concessional rates and data are in U.S. dollars calculated using historical rates. **The World Bank** complies with all sanctions applicable to World Bank transactions.  You will also find a detailed data dictionary among other details.

To perform my analysis, I uploaded the data and ran SQL queries using [**csvfiddle.io**](https://csvfiddle.io), an open-source tool that allows its users to run SQL queries exclusively in-browser eliminating the need to download software like MySQL on their computer.


## THE ANALYSIS
---

**SQL commands used while performing my analysis include:**

âœ…SELECT* âœ…FROM table_name âœ…LIMIT âœ…AS âœ…WHERE âœ…COUNT âœ…GROUP BY âœ…ORDER BY 
âœ… MIN/MAX âœ…SUM âœ…AVG âœ…AND/OR/NOT

---

The main purpose of the analysis was to look over the dataset of  IDA transactions consisting of loans in the form of credits or grants and provide insights on the following questions:

- ðŸ’¡What is the total number of transactions?

- ðŸ’¡What is the total amount owed to the IDA?

- ðŸ’¡What is the total number of transactions with balances due per country?

- ðŸ’¡How many loans per country?

- ðŸ’¡What country has the most loans?

- ðŸ’¡What is the MAX/MIN loan owed to the IDA?

- ðŸ’¡What is the total number of projects for India?

- ðŸ’¡How many loans did India receive for each project?

- ðŸ’¡Which project in India is responsible for the highest balance owed?

- ðŸ’¡What is the average service charge rate for a loan?

---

I started with a simple **SELECT * FROM table_name** query to become more familiar with the data and get a feel for things.  There are over **1.24 Million** rows representing the total amount of transactions made with the IDA. Because the dataset consists of over **1M rows** I added a **LIMIT** clause to the initial query to only display the first several hundred rows.  **Note:**  I also had to add a **LIMIT** clause to other queries due to the large size of the dataset.

Next, I queried to find the total amount owed to the IDA using a **SUM** function. The total is over **19 Trillion US dollars** ($19,204,389,797,689.50).

I then wanted to take a look at the total number of transactions with balances due per country using the borrower, DueToIda, and country fields.  The initial query resulted in multiple borrowers with **zero dollars** owed and borrowers with the same or similar names listed so I filtered out the zero balances using a **WHERE** clause. Results showed that there were over **639,000 loans** with balances due at the time of my analysis.

Of those **639,000 loans**, how many loans are held by each country?  Using a **COUNT** function with **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** clauses, I ran another query. Results indicated there were **136 countries** with outstanding loans.  At the time of analysis, **India** held the top position with **56,190** outstanding loans.  Among the **top 5** countries were **India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Ghana**.

<img src="images/Code2Query2.png?raw=true"/>

Next, I set out to find which country owed the largest amount in loans to the IDA and which owed the least.  Using **MAX/MIN** functions, results showed that **India** owes the largest single loan amount just shy of **800 Million US dollars** coming in at $793,256,128.00. **Mozambique** appears to have a credit in the amount of **-$5.37**.

<img src="images/Code5.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/Code5Query.png?raw=true"/>

With **India** owing just shy of **800M US dollars** to the IDA, I wanted to dive a little deeper.  First, I listed all **56,190** transactions and their corresponding fields for the country.

<img src="images/Code6Query.png?raw=true"/>

Next, I filtered to find the total number of projects for **India**. There are over **39,500** different project names listed for **India**.

<img src="images/Code7.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/Code7Query.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/Code7Query2A.png?raw=true"/>

Some projects have multiple loans. For Example, there are **over 136 HIGHWAYS, 294 RAILWAYS, and 276 TELECOMMUNICATIONS** projects all of which have a **ZERO Balance**.

<img src="images/Code10.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/Code10Query.png?raw=true"/>

Next, I wanted to know which project in **India** was responsible for the highest balance owed.  Results revealed that the **IN: SSA III**, an elementary school education project focused on providing better outcomes for children, was the largest loan owed by India and the largest loan owed to the IDA at nearly **$800 Million US dollars**.

IDA loan financing terms are determined with reference to recipient countries' risk of debt distress, the level of GNI per capita, and creditworthiness for the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) borrowing.  The **average service rate charge** for an IDA loan was **0.77%** at the time of my analysis. Rates were as high as **4.95%** and as low as **0%**.

## IN CONCLUSION
---

The **IDA** has served as a primary source of financing since its creation in 1960.  There are currently a total of **75** countries eligible to receive **IDA** resources. With funding, some of the world's poorest countries have been given the tools necessary to confront the effects of poverty and, the ability to develop themselves at a rate that far exceeds what they could have done alone.  Some countries have even come full circle and are now contributors to the very institution that provided aid in their time of need.  

The work that the **IDA** should not be measured in dollars and cents but, rather, the immense impact that can be seen around the globe ðŸŒŽ.
